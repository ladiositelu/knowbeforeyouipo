Using NLP techniques to identify the priorities and challenges of companies.  

A company that is about to go public is required to provide a comprehensive legal document that discusses their business and future challenges amongst other things.

To help solve this problem, knowbeforeyouipo parses the document and provides key words that help to describe the key issues discussed using a natural language processing technique called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
